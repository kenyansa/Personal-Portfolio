        <p>
            I have only done one project in GitHub with my team, Group 1 of the Cohort-Scar. The team was comprised of five members and later another member joined us. 
            I executed the "features" section, with a lot of guessing. I must however admit that the most challenging part during the project was understanding the git commands with Ubuntu. It's called "Growth". &#128514;&#128514;
        <br>
        The project is on GitHUb through this link <a href="https://github.com/kenyansa">First Project on GitHub</a>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Lately, I've been attracted to the field of programming. I joined Moringa school to obtain the skills I need to become a developer. 
            Software engineering has the capicity for personal growth, immeasurbaly more than you can imagine, when compared to other fields.

        <h2>Current Interests</h2>
        <p>
            Currently, I am working to be a cerified cloud practitioner with the AWS, at the associate level. I love cloud computing and the efficiency it provides businesses and individual persons. 
            It has never been this easy to start up a company without having to precisely determine the cost of storage and processing. You only need to start your firm, and provision for the resources you need as time goes by... 
            Very cool indeed!!
